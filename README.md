# Residual-CNN-on-CIFAR10

## Overview
This project implements a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Residual Networks (ResNets) are a type of deep neural network known for their ability to train very deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Features
- **Residual Network Architecture**: Utilizes residual connections to improve training of deep networks.
- **CIFAR-10 Classification**: Trains a ResNet model to classify images into one of the 10 CIFAR-10 classes.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies various data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
